# Files

The file ```agroforestry_project.Rmd``` is __report__ that includes a thematic introduction, the methodology used in the analysis, as well as results and discussion. It can be knitted into a ```html``` file by default.


In the folder ```data```, the __input table__ ```input_table.csv```is stored.


We set the r-project ```NEPAL_pepper_AF.rproj``` as working directory.


In the folder ```results```, an image of the conceptual model ```conceptual_model.jpg``` as well as results from the Monte Carlo simulation ```mc_simulation_results.csv``` and EVPI calculation ```2_evpi_results.csv```are stored.
